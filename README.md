# data-structure
problem solving with data structures

## array_rotation
Write a function rotate(ar[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.
Time complexity : O(1)

## binary_search
An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search

## pair_with_a_given_sum
Find if the array has a pair with a given sum ‘x’.
for arrays with distinc array Time Complexity is O(n)

## samllest_missing_parameter
Given a sorted array of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 0 to m-1 and m > n. Find the smallest number that is missing from the array.
for sum cases it works with Time Complexity of O(Logn)

## largest_sum_contiguous_subarray
Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.
Time Complexity: O(n)

## find_equilibrium_index_of_an_array
Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.
Time Complexity: O(n)

## linked_list_traverse
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
Time Complexity: read -> O(n)

## insert_in_linked_list
Add a node at the front with Time Complexity: insert -> O(1)


## delete_from_linked_list
To delete a node from linked list, we need to do following steps: Find previous node of the node to be deleted, Change the next of previous node Free memory for the node to be deleted.
Time Complexity: deletion -> O(n)

## balanced_brackets
Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, print YES on a new line; otherwise, print NO on a new line.
Time Complexity: O(n)

## maximum_repeated_element
Given an array with repeated elements, the task is to find the maximum distance two occurrences of an element.
Time complexity : O(n)
