problem solving with data structures

## array_rotation
Write a function rotate(ar[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.
Time complexity : O(1)

## binary_search
An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search

## pair_with_a_given_sum
Find if the array has a pair with a given sum ‘x’.
for arrays with distinc array Time Complexity is O(n)

## samllest_missing_parameter
Given a sorted array of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 0 to m-1 and m > n. Find the smallest number that is missing from the array.
for sum cases it works with Time Complexity of O(Logn)

## larges sum contiguous subarray
Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.
Time Complexity: O(n)
