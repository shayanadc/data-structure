# data-structure
problem solving with data structures

## array_rotation
Write a function rotate(ar[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.
Time complexity : O(1)

## binary_search
An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search

## pair_with_a_given_sum
Find if the array has a pair with a given sum ‘x’.
for arrays with unique numbers Time Complexity is O(n)
